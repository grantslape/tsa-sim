First thing I notice is that this should be a threaded application for ease of design.  Some research leads me to the 
LinkedBlockingQueue which seems to have the correct design for my purposes.

1 minute will be reduced to one second for the purpose of the simulation.

we need a consumer on the beginning of queue c possibly? - Yes

Maybe if the length has increased, we increase expediteTime by one tick.
Then maybe if queue length is decreasing we can reduce expediteTime with a floor of 0.

TimeToProcess = rand(params) - expediteTime
